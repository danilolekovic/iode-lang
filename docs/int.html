                In Iode, ints are numbers. They are all defined by consisting of the numbers 0 to 9. Long numbers can be separated by
                an underscore ("_"), which does not change the numbers in any way other than appearance.

            <p>
                In the code sample above, the variable "age" is set to 42. The variable "bankAccount" is set to a surprising 1,000,000.
                This value is showcased as "1_000_000" but is really 1000000.
